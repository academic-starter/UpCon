IPT is the governance token of Interest Protocol.\r\n\r\nUsers can mint 1 USDi by depositing 1 USDC into the protocol, and anyone can receive 1 USDC from the protocol by burning 1 USDi that they hold. In addition, users can deposit assets into a multi-collateral vault and borrow USDi against that collateral. \r\n\r\nRegardless of how they obtained USDi, all USDi holders automatically earn yield without having to spend gas to stake. Given the same amount of capital, Interest Protocol can generate more loans with less liquidity risk than existing lending protocols without fractional reserves.\r\n\r\nInterest Protocol automatically manages its reserve ratio\u2014USDC in the protocol\u2019s reserve over the total supply of USDi\u2014by employing a variable interest rate system. As the reserve ratio decreases, the borrow and deposit rates of USDi increase, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Many IPT Tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nAt launch, there will be 100 million IPT tokens in existence. 20% of this will be unissued and held in the protocol treasury. Through governance proposals, IPT holders can collectively decide to mint additional IPT tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who Built Interest Protocol?\r\n\r\nInterest Protocol was developed by GFX Labs. GFX Labs started in 2021 with the goal of building web 3 applications that facilitate ownership and improve usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Buy IPT?\r\n\r\nIPT can be purchased by participating in the [IPT sale](https://interestprotocol.io/#/sale).",
